# WeatherWebsite
A lightweight user-friendly weather website that is packaged in a single HTML file.
Check it out [here](https://buildsgordon.github.io/WeatherWebsite/Index.html).

**Purpose:** Most weather sites are bloated with ads, pop-ups, and distracting news feeds. This one only has the forecast, clean and simple.

**Instructions:** Simply download the index.html file and view the weather.

**Features**
- Weather up to 14 days
- Has basic statistics (Temp,Humidity, RainChance, UV, Description)
- Has dark mode/ Light mode
- Has temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit

I am open to suggestions, please email any questions.


NOTE: If you are viewing a location that is not your current coutry (or using a VPN), international time differences may make the program off by one day.
